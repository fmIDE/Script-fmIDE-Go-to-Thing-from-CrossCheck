# fmIDE
[A FileMaker Integrated Development Environment]

[fmIDE](https://github.com/fmIDE/fmIDE) is a module for FileMaker files which it makes it possible for tools to 'deep link' into the FileMaker Development Environment.

# CrossCheckâ„¢

[CrossCheckâ„¢](http://www.fm-crosscheck.com) is a FileMaker analysis tool from [[x] cross solutions GmbH](https://www.cross-solutions.de/).

# Script "fmIDE-Go to Thing from CrossCheck"

[The `fmIDE-Go to Thing from CrossCheck` script](Script-fmIDE-Go-to-Thing-from-CrossCheck.txt) is the bridge between CrossCheckâ„¢ and your database solutions (using the [fmIDE-'Name-that-Thing' API](https://github.com/fmIDE/fmIDE/wiki/fmIDE-'Name-that-Thing'-API))

In one click it jumps from the thing you are currently looking at in CrossCheckâ„¢ directly to that thing in your database.
